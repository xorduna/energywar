# Energy War Game Development Process

## Game Creation Workflow

1. **Game Initialization**
   - User navigates to index.html
   - Selects game visibility (public/private)
   - Clicks "New Game" button
   - Backend generates unique game ID
   - Frontend displays game details and shareable link

2. **Game Sharing**
   - Automatically generates join game URL
   - Provides clipboard copy functionality
   - URL includes game ID as query parameter
   - Supports easy game invitation

3. **Game Joining**
   - Dedicated join.html page
   - Supports two joining methods:
     a. Direct URL with pre-filled game ID
     b. Manual game ID and player name entry
   - Validates input before joining
   - Retrieves authentication token

## Authentication Process

1. **Token Generation**
   - Tokens created uniquely for each player when joining a game
   - Tokens are random, secure strings
   - Stored server-side with player information

2. **Token Validation**
   - Required for sensitive game actions:
     * Setting board configuration
     * Marking player as ready
     * Performing strikes
     * Accessing board information
   - Validated on each protected API endpoint
   - Prevents unauthorized game manipulation

## Security Considerations

1. **Endpoint Protection**
   - Token-based authentication
   - 403 Forbidden response for invalid/missing tokens
   - Prevents unauthorized access to game-specific actions

2. **Game State Management**
   - Tokens tied to specific game and player
   - Tokens not reusable across different games
   - Tokens expire with game completion

## Frontend Flow

1. **index.html**
   - Game creation interface
   - Public/private game selection
   - Generates shareable game link
   - Clipboard copy functionality

2. **join.html**
   - Dedicated game joining page
   - Supports URL-based and manual game joining
   - Input validation
   - API interaction for game join

3. **player.html**
   - Game board setup
   - Player interactions
   - Real-time game state management
   - Token-based authentication

## Development Best Practices

1. **Modular Design**
   - Separate concerns between frontend and backend
   - Clear API contract
   - Extensible architecture

2. **Security First**
   - Token-based authentication
   - Input validation
   - Minimal information exposure

3. **User Experience**
   - Simple game creation and joining
   - Easy game sharing
   - Intuitive interfaces

## Continuous Improvement

- Regular security audits
- Performance optimization
- User feedback integration
- Feature enhancements
